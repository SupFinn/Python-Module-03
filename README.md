# 🎮 Data Quest  
### *Mastering Python Collections for Data Engineering*


---

## 📌 Description

**Data Quest** is a Python project focused on mastering **core data structures** used in data engineering:  
**lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, generators, and comprehensions**.

Set in the *Pixel Dimension*, this project turns abstract concepts into concrete,
game-inspired data engineering challenges. You will build analytics systems,
process player data, handle streams efficiently, and transform datasets using
clean and expressive Python patterns.

This project emphasizes **clarity, efficiency, and data-oriented thinking** —
skills every real data engineer must master.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn how to:

- 📦 Use Python collections effectively and intentionally
- 🧠 Choose the right data structure for each problem
- 🧮 Process command-line data safely and cleanly
- 🔁 Analyze data using lists, sets, and dictionaries
- 🌊 Handle large or infinite data streams with generators
- ✨ Transform data elegantly using comprehensions
- 🛠 Build small but realistic data engineering pipelines

---

## 🧪 Exercises Overview

### 🧾 Exercise 0 — Command Quest
Learn how programs receive external data using the command line.  
Understand `sys.argv`, argument counting, and user input processing.

---

### 📊 Exercise 1 — Score Cruncher
Analyze player scores using **lists**.  
Compute totals, averages, min/max values, and handle invalid inputs gracefully.

---

### 📍 Exercise 2 — Position Tracker
Use **tuples** to represent immutable 3D coordinates.  
Parse coordinate strings, calculate distances, and practice tuple unpacking.

---

### 🏆 Exercise 3 — Achievement Hunter
Track achievements using **sets**.  
Deduplicate data, compare player progress, and perform set analytics
(union, intersection, difference).

---

### 🎒 Exercise 4 — Inventory Master
Build a full inventory system using **dictionaries**.  
Manage nested data, calculate values, group items, and generate reports.

---

### 🌊 Exercise 5 — Stream Wizard
Process large event streams using **generators**.  
Learn memory-efficient data processing and on-demand data generation.

---

### 🧪 Exercise 6 — Data Alchemist
Combine everything using **comprehensions**.  
Transform data with list, dict, and set comprehensions to create a compact
analytics dashboard.

---

## ⚙️ Rules & Constraints

- Python **3.10+**
- Code must follow **flake8** standards
- No file I/O — all data is processed via:
  - Command-line arguments
  - In-memory structures
- Only `sys` import is allowed where specified
- Programs must **never crash**
- Focus on **clarity over complexity**
- Demonstrate **why** each data structure is used

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This project is about **thinking like a data engineer**.

You are expected to:
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of each collection type
- Write readable, maintainable code
- Prefer expressive Python patterns over verbose logic
- Justify your data structure choices
- Build systems that scale conceptually, not just syntactically

Short code is not the goal — **clear and correct code is**.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Each exercise can be tested directly from the terminal:

```bash
python3 your_file.py [arguments]
```
